        "\n",

        "SOAP vs REST: Key Differences\n",
        "\n",
        "1️⃣ Type\n",
        "\n",
        "SOAP is a protocol with strict messaging rules.\n",
        "\n",
        "REST is an architectural style that follows standard web principles.\n",
        "\n",
        "2️⃣ Data Format\n",
        "\n",
        "SOAP only uses XML for requests and responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "REST supports multiple formats like JSON, XML, HTML, and plain text.\n",

        "3️⃣ Performance\n",
